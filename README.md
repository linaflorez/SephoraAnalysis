# Sephora Analysis

__Project Background__

As a frequent consumer of retail stores like as Sephora, I came across a compelling dataset that presented a unique opportunity to delve into comprehensive consumer information. This dataset allowed me to meticulously analysize consumer preferences, identifying prominent brands, trending product types, and evolving consumer response. Through this analysis, I'm wanting to gain insights into market trends and consumer inclinations, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving consumer choices and industry trends.

__Focus__

Building from my initial analysis, I'm interested in taking this a step further with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to perform a sentiment analysis of certain product types and brands. In the future, I'd also like to work towards making a recommender system based on the customer purchases and reviews to recommend products that align with their preferences.


Questions to consider (for now):

  1. Most popular brands?
  2. Most popular category of items?
  3. Most popular item from the most popular brands?
